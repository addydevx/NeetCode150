// Approach 1 - ðŸ§  Concept

Anagrams are words formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

All anagrams have the same characters with the same frequency.

âœ… Approach: Hash Map with Sorted String Key

Idea:

Sort each word â†’ use the sorted word as a key in a hash map.

All anagrams will share the same sorted form.

Steps:

for word in strs:
    key = ''.join(sorted(word))
    anagram_map[key].append(word)


Time Complexity: O(n * k log k)

n: number of strings

k: max length of a string
(due to sorting each string)

Space Complexity: O(nk)

For storing grouped anagrams in the hash map
